        ### Why differential equations?

        * Differential equations form a mathematical language that can
          accurately describe objects in the world that change over time.
          Proficiency in dealing with differential equations is therefore
          vital for systems science and engineering. Several examples are
          presented below:

          - Simulation of a linear RLC circuit, comparing the performance
            of the 'odeint' and 'solve_ivp' solvers. With the default
            settings in both solvers, 'odeint' demonstrates faster
            execution time and better accuracy. Therefore, 'odeint'
            wins in this scenario. (A solver from the control system
            library is also employed, but which can be used only
            for linear time-invariant systems where analytic solutions
            are available.)

          - Simulation of the Lorenz system featuring chaotic behavior
            depending on the paramters. 'odeint' is faster than 'solve_ivp'
            in this case as well. Numerical errors cannot be computed here
            as analytic solutions are not available.

          - Simulation of ligand-receptor interactions, a common phenomenon
            in biomolecular systems. This simulation involves a discontinuity
            in the internal receptor generation, which poses challenges
            when using the 'odeint' solver. In this case, 'ivp_solve'
            wins. (To be added soon)
    
        #### What TWY does
    
        * TWY teaches engineering mathematics, signals and systems,
          technical writing, etc., at Korea University.

        * This is for my students in the 'Nonlinear Systems' course.
          All the scripts are written in python using the
          Streamlit framework.
        
        * TWY's playground app, which has more examples than
          differential equations, is given
          [here](https://twy-playground.streamlit.app/)
